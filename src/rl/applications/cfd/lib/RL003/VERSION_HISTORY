### CHANGE LOG VERSION HISTORY TEMPLATE####
Last Update: 16.06.2021

D-LT-A07:
	Change of result averageing time (3 * alpha_DEG + 6)*c/U_inf
	Artificial Averageing Timestep 100 --> 1000
	Apply BLC after steady state step
	Changed U.orig from noSlip to fixedValue 0 0 0 at wall to allow funkySetBoundaryField
	
D-LT-A08:
    Change of development time: 20 --> 10 flow over times
    Change of result averageing time (1 * alpha_DEG + 1)*c/U_inf
    Added Monitor Forces GnuPlotScript
    increased parallel computation: 16 --> 32 cores
    Made steadyState Phase longer

D-LT-A09:
    Wake sampling from D-L-B01
    Remove LM transitional model --> plain k omega SST

K23n:
    Recreated K23 setup to run more indepently as orignal one and also compatible with identical control and setup scripts as instationary ones
    
K23n2:
    Changed to bounded Schemes for steadyState simulation for better convergence

RL002:
    Prepared for implementation of Reinforcemen learning.
